## What is EnchanTips?
EnchanTips is a mod that extends the tootip to show more information about the enchantment.  
EnchanTips add these things to the tooltip
- What the enchantment does
- What items work with the enchantment
- If any, what enchantments are incompatible with it
- The highest level the enchantment can go up to
## How do I use this?
EnchanTips is being coded using the 1.16.4 Forge MDK. Therefore, it is advisable to install this mod on 1.16.4 forge installation.  
After you install this mod, you will be able to press shift while hovering over an enchanted item to extend the tooltip.
## Caveats
You will not be able to view the extended tooltip on items with more than 3 enchantments or else the tooltip will become too large.  
If there are multiple enchantments on an item, the extended tooltip will not explain the enchantments in order.  
I am trying to find out a solution to this issue that makes sense so if you have any suggestion, go ahead and make a pull request.
