## What is EnchanTips?
EnchanTips is a mod that extends the tootip for enchanted items to show more information about the enchantment.  
EnchanTips adds the following to the tooltip
- What the enchantment does
- What items work with the enchantment
- If any, what enchantments are incompatible with it
- The highest level the enchantment can go up to

## How do I use this?
EnchanTips is being coded using the `1.16.4 Forge MDK`. However, any version of down to 1.16 should work.  
After you install this mod, you will be able to press shift while hovering over an enchanted item to extend the tooltip.

## Caveats
You will not be able to view the extended tooltip on items with more than 3 enchantments or else the tooltip will become too large.  
If there are multiple enchantments on an item, the extended tooltip will not explain the enchantments in order of the item.  
I am trying to find out a solution to these issues that make sense so if you have any suggestion, contact me or make a pull request.
